### Folder organization
This repository contains two main folders: Slides and Samples. Slides contains PDF files of lectures slides. Samples from the lectures are in folder Samples. Except the first few introductory examples, all other examples are created as part of Maven projects in order to be easily imported in IDE of a choice.

## Prerequisites

Assignments are distributed using Github classroom. Therefore, students should have GitHub account and basic knowledge of Git (i.e. how to clone, commit and push files). More about grading, homework, labs, links to assignments, and deadline would be explained later.

Students should be familiar with basic programming concepts (i.e. loops, functions) preferably (but not necessary) in C or some C style language.

## Homework

### Homework #1 (5 points)
Deadline: Wednesday, July 10th 8:00 (local time)

Accept the homework assignement using GitHub class link: [https://classroom.github.com/a/NPuYoGeI](https://classroom.github.com/a/NPuYoGeI), and push your code until the deadline.
